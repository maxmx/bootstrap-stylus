Bootstrap Stylus 2.3.0
======================

Port of the amazing [Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.0](http://url.com/ "Title") to [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/).

This version does not have any dependencies on [nib](https://github.com/visionmedia/nib).

There might be some slight color differences due to the differences between the color functions in LESS and those in Stylus.

- Compile bootstrap.styl to get the basic stylesheet.
- Compile responsive.styl to get the additional responsive stylesheets.

_Note: This translation is fixed to 12 columns_
